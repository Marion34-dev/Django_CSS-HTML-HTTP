# Django program

## About the program
This program was created to get a grasp of Django and HTTP. I have also created several html pages using CSS and HTML. 

## Usage section
You can launch the program by typing the command 'python manage.py runserver' in the terminal and you will be able to access the index (welcome) page and will be able to navigate through the different pages.
